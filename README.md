# slingshot-GDX
Repository for my libgdx game "slingshot GDX"
To run the project on desktop select the lwjgl3 gradle command, or android for the android version of it.
The code is a little disorganized, but if you're interested in learning how to make an android game using the following libgdx libraries: JBump, Fleks entity component system and a little bit of GDXdilogs; than this project might be useful.
